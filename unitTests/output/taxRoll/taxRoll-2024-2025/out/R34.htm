Investment securities classified as HTM, which management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, are reported at amortized cost. Investment securities classified as AFS are intended to be held for an indefinite period of time. These securities are carried at fair value and unrealized gains and losses, net of related deferred income taxes, are included in stockholders' equity as a separate component of OCI. Investment securities classified as equity securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value immediately reflected in the consolidated statements of income. Any decision to sell AFS securities would be based on various factors, including, but not limited to, asset/liability management strategies, changes in interest rates or prepayment risks, liquidity needs, or regulatory capital considerations. Realized gains or losses on investment security sales (using specific identification method) are included in investment securities gains (losses), net, on the consolidated statements of income. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into interest income over the estimated life (earlier of call date, maturity, or estimated life) of the related security, using a prospective method that approximates level yield. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In certain situations, management may elect to transfer certain investment securities from the AFS classification to the HTM classification.

The accrual of interest income for consumer loans is discontinued when loans reach specific delinquency levels. Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments, unless the loan is well-secured and in the process of collection. Additionally, whenever management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that may adversely impact the collectability of principal or interest on loans, it is management&#8217;s practice to place such loans on a nonaccrual status immediately, rather than delaying such action until the loans become 90 days past due. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed, amortization of related deferred loan fees or costs is suspended, and income is recorded only to the extent that interest payments are subsequently received in cash and a determination has been made that the principal and interest of the loan is collectible.

The concessions granted generally involve the modification of terms of the loan, such as changes in payment schedule or interest rate, which generally would not otherwise be considered. Restructured loans can involve loans remaining on nonaccrual, moving to nonaccrual, or continuing on accrual status, depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower. Nonaccrual restructured loans are included and treated with all other nonaccrual loans. Generally, restructured loans remain on nonaccrual until the customer has attained a sustained period of repayment performance under the modified loan terms (generally a minimum of six months). However, performance prior to the restructuring, or significant events that coincide with the restructuring, are considered in assessing whether the borrower can meet the new terms and whether the loan should be returned to or maintained on accrual status. If the borrower&#8217;s ability to meet the revised payment schedule is not reasonably assured, the loan remains on nonaccrual status.

The expected lifetime credit losses are the product of multiplying the Corporation's estimate of probability of default, loss given default, and the individual loan level exposure at default on an undiscounted basis. The Corporation estimates the lifetime expected loss using prepayment assumptions over the projected lifetime cash flow of these loans. Actual credit losses, net of recoveries, are deducted from the allowance for loan losses. A provision for credit losses, which is a charge against earnings, is recorded to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level that, in management&#8217;s judgment, is appropriate to absorb the expected lifetime losses in the loan portfolio.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The Corporation applies a methodology that is designed to assess the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses within the Corporation's loan segmentation. The methodology also focuses on the evaluation of several factors, including but not limited to: evaluation of facts and issues related to specific loans, management&#8217;s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio using a dual risk rating system consisting of probability of default and loss given default models, which are based on loan grades for commercial loans and credit reports for consumer loans applied based on portfolio segmentation leveraging industry breakouts in commercial and industrial and property types in CRE for commercial loans and loan types for consumer loans, consideration of historical loan loss and delinquency experience on each portfolio category, trends in past due and nonaccrual loans, the level of potential problem loans, the risk characteristics of the various classifications of loans, changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio, concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries, existing economic conditions and economic forecasts, the fair value of underlying collateral, and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The Corporation utilizes the Moody's Baseline economic forecast in the allowance model and applies that forecast over a reasonable and supportable period with reversion to historical losses. For additional detail on the reasonable and supportable period and reversion inputs, see Note 3. The Corporation estimates the lifetime expected loss using prepayment assumptions over the projected lifetime cash flows of the loan. Because each of the criteria used is subject to change, the analysis of the allowance for loan losses is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future loan losses in any particular loan category. The total allowance for loan losses is available to absorb losses from any segment of the loan portfolio.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Management individually analyzes loans that do not share similar risk characteristics to other loans in the portfolio. Management has determined that commercial loan relationships over $500,000 that have nonaccrual status meet this definition. Accrued interest receivable on loans is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. The ACLL attributable to the loan is allocated based on management&#8217;s estimate of the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral, other sources of cash flows, as well as evaluation of legal options available to the Corporation. The amount of expected loan loss is measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s effective interest rate, the fair value of the underlying collateral less applicable selling costs, or the observable market price of the loan. If foreclosure is probable or the loan is collateral dependent, impairment is measured using the fair value of the loan&#8217;s collateral, less costs to sell. Large groups of homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgage, home equity, auto finance, and other consumer, are collectively evaluated for impairment. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The allowance for unfunded commitments leverages the same methodology utilized to measure the allowance for loan losses. The Corporation estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Corporation is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Corporation. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. See Note 3 for additional information on the ACLL and Note 15 for additional information on the allowance for unfunded commitments.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">A portion of the ACLL is comprised of adjustments for qualitative factors not reflected in the quantitative model.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Management believes that the level of the ACLL is appropriate. While management uses currently available information to recognize losses on loans, future adjustments to the ACLL may be necessary based on newly received appraisals, updated commercial customer financial statements, rapidly deteriorating cash flow, and changes in economic conditions that affect our customers. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Corporation&#8217;s ACLL. Such agencies may require additions to the ACLL or may require that certain loan balances be charged off or downgraded into criticized loan categories when their credit evaluations differ from those of management based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations. See Loans above for further policy discussion and see Note 3 for additional information on the allowance for loan losses.</span></div><span></span>

The impairment testing process is conducted by assigning net assets and goodwill to each reporting unit. An initial qualitative evaluation is made to assess the likelihood of impairment and determine whether further quantitative testing to calculate the fair value is necessary. When the qualitative evaluation indicates that impairment is more likely than not, quantitative testing is required whereby the fair value of each reporting unit is calculated and compared to the recorded book value, &#8220;step one.&#8221; If the calculated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired.

Upon sale of loans, MSRs assets are capitalized and recorded at the current fair value of future net cash flows expected to be realized for performing servicing activities. The Corporation has made the irrevocable election to account for its MSRs asset under the fair value measurement method. Under this methodology, changes in the fair value are recognized in earnings as they occur through mortgage banking, net on the consolidated statements of income. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">MSRs are not traded in active markets. A cash flow model is used to determine fair value. Key assumptions and estimates, including projected prepayment speeds, assumed servicing costs, ancillary income, costs to service delinquent loans, costs of foreclosure, and discount rates with option-adjusted spreads, used by this model are based on current market sources. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Assumptions used to value MSRs are considered significant unobservable inputs. A separate third-party model is used to estimate prepayment speeds based on interest rates, housing turnover rates, estimated loan curtailment, anticipated defaults and other relevant factors. Fair value estimates from outside sources are received periodically to corroborate the results of the valuation model. See Note 4 for additional information on MSRs.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Prior to January 1, 2022 and the irrevocable election to account for MSRs under fair value, upon sale of loans, MSRs assets were capitalized and recorded at the current fair value of future net cash flows expected to be realized for performing servicing activities. MSRs, when purchased, are initially recorded at fair value. As the Corporation had not elected to subsequently measure any class of servicing assets under the fair value measurement method, the Corporation followed the amortization method. MSRs were amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income, and assessed for impairment at each reporting date. MSRs were carried at the lower of the initial capitalized amount, net of accumulated amortization, or estimated fair value, on the consolidated balance sheets.</span></div><div><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The Corporation periodically evaluated its MSRs asset for impairment. Impairment was assessed based on fair value at each reporting date using estimated prepayment speeds of the underlying mortgage loans serviced and stratifications based on the risk characteristics of the underlying loans (predominantly loan type and note interest rate). As mortgage interest rates fall, prepayment speeds are usually faster and the value of the MSRs asset generally decreases, requiring additional valuation reserve. Conversely, as mortgage interest rates rise, prepayment speeds are usually slower and the value of the MSRs asset generally increases, requiring less valuation reserve. A valuation allowance was established, through a charge to earnings, to the extent the amortized cost of the MSRs exceeded the estimated fair value by stratification. If it was later determined that all or a portion of the temporary impairment no longer existed for a stratification, the valuation was reduced through a recovery to earnings. An other-than-temporary impairment (i.e., recoverability was considered remote when considering interest rates and loan pay off activity) was recognized as a write-down of the MSRs asset and the related valuation allowance (to the extent a valuation allowance was available) and then against earnings. A direct write-down permanently reduces the carrying value of the MSRs asset and valuation allowance, precluding subsequent recoveries. See Note 5 for additional information on MSRs.</span></div><span></span>

Accounting for changes in fair value of derivatives depends on whether the derivative is designated and qualifies in a hedging relationship. At inception, the Corporation designates the derivative contract as either a fair value hedge (i.e., a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability), a cash flow hedge (i.e., a hedge of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability), or a non-designated hedge.</span></div><div style="margin-bottom:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Changes in the fair value of a derivative that has been designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, along with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current period earnings.

Notional values of interest rate swaps and other off-balance sheet financial instruments significantly exceed the credit risk associated with these instruments and represent contractual balances on which calculations of amounts to be exchanged are based. Credit exposure is limited to the sum of the aggregate fair value of positions that have become favorable to the Corporation, including any accrued interest receivable due from counterparties. Potential credit losses are mitigated by derivatives through central clearing parties, careful evaluation of counterparty credit standing, selection of counterparties from a limited group of high quality institutions, collateral agreements, and other contract provisions. The corporation considers the value of collateral held and collateral provided in determining the net carrying value of derivatives.

As there is no active market for many of the Corporation&#8217;s financial instruments, estimates are made using discounted cash flow or other valuation techniques. Inputs into the valuation methods are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties, and require significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Accordingly, the derived fair value estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Corporation could realize in a current market exchange. Assets and liabilities are categorized into three levels based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Corporation&#8217;s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
