# XINCE Examples
## Overview
The XINCE syntax is a domain specific language used to define and create XBRL instances. The XINCE language uses the XULE syntax to manipulate facts prior to outputting XBRL instances in a JSON or XML format.

The XINCE Examples have the following folder structure:

* Source: Source files defined using XINCE that create XBRL instance documents.
* Compiled: Compiled xule zip models (ruleset files) that create the instance when run.
* Output: Folder with the generated Instance Documents

## Example 1. - Create Single Fact Instance
This example creates a single fact instance using the US-GAAP taxonomy.
